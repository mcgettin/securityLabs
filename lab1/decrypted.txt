one variation to the standard caesar cipher is when the alphabet is "keyed" by using a word. 
in the traditional variety, one could write the alphabet on two strips and just match up the 
strips after sliding the bottom strip to the left or right. to encode, you would find a letter 
in the top row and substitute it for the letter in the bottom row. for a keyed version, one would 
not use a standard alphabet, but would first write a word (omitting duplicated letters) and then 
write the remaining letters of the alphabet. for the example below, i used a key of "rumkin.com" 
and you will see that the period is removed because it is not a letter. you will also notice the 
second "m" is not included because there was an m already and you can't have duplicates.
